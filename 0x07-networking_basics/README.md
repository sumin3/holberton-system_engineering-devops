## Purpose
- To learn what's OSI model
- To learn What is a LAN and WAN
- To learn What is the Internet
- To learn What is IP address
- To learn What is TCP/UDP
- To learn What are TCP/UDP Ports
- To learn What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
---
## Coding style
- All Bash script text files are executable and are interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. They all pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1 via apt-get) without any errors.
